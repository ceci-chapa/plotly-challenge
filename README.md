# Plotly Challenge

For this challenge we are tasked to build an interactive dashboard for a Belly Button Biodiversity study. For the dashboard we will need to include a horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 OTUs, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and a card that displays the demographic information for each sample.
